# Lending-Club-Loan-History-Prediction

# Introduction

One of the bank’s main objectives is to make profit. Lending is one of the services to help make the bank profit through interest made on the loan. Because the banks are lending money from pre-existing customers who hold their money in the bank, it is important to minimize the risk of a loss by meticulously screening an applicant of a loan. 

LendingClub is a financial service company who helps facilitate loans via individual/group of funders. We will be working with existing loan data from 2012-2014 that was made available by LendingClub. The dataset includes the current loan status as well as various features of an applicant (e.g. loan amount, fico score, annual income, etc.) 

# Abstract

We are interested in classifying is whether a loan applicant is going to default on a loan or not. We will be using LendingClub’s dataset and developing various machine learning classification models to determine which model is the most accurate at making predictions. From the many variables included in the dataset, we narrow down the most relevant predictors that contribute to the accuracy of our model. Once we have explored the dataset and determined the best prediction model, we will attempt to make tune the model to improve performance.
